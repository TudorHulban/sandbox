# Client and server example

This example shows a simple client and server.

The server echoes messages sent to it. The client sends a message every second
and prints all messages received.

To run the example, start the server:

```sh
go run server.go
```

Next, start the client:

```sh
go run client.go
```

The server includes a simple web client. To use the client, open
the specified at run time link in the browser and follow the instructions on the page.
