SOLID
From Stackoverflow:
> To better understand the SOLID principles you have to understand the problem that they solve:

> Object-oriented programming grew out of structured/procedural programming--it added a new organizational system (classes, et al) as well as behaviors (polymorphism, inheritance, composition). This meant that OO was not seperate from structured/procedural, but was a progression, and that developers could do very procedural OO if they wanted.

> So... SOLID came around as something of a litmus test to answer the question of "Am I really doing OO, or am I just using procedural objects?" The 5 principles, if followed, means that you are quite far to the OO side of the spectrum. Failing to meet these rules doesn't mean you're not doing OO, but it means its much more structural/procedural OO.
