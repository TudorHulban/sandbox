# GraphQL Template / Example
## How to use
The initial sequence to use was:
```sh
make reset
make init
```
For future updates in *.graphqls files:
```sh
go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen
```
If want to start over on resolvers:
```sh
make generate
```
If want to start from scratch the initial sequence should be used.
